DEPRECATED
==========

This extension is deprecated: it was written for Opera 12, it will not work (I guess?) on Opera >= 15.

Meme Panel Opera extension
==========================

This is a silly Opera extension to create meme images quickly. It uses
the http://memegenerator.net
[API](http://version1.api.memegenerator.net) (yes, it actually has a
programming API!).

Some parts of it are somewhat dirty, but the code is otherwise decent
and should be easy to follow (at least if you know the excellent
[Angular](http://angularjs.org) Javascript framework; if you don't, go
learn it, it's good for you).

It has tests for the base classes, written using
[js-test-driver](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/). I was too
lazy to write tests for the UI part, too much work and I guess it's
more likely to change anyway.
